            <h2>What the Brand Stands For</h2>
            <p>
              We stand for fashion that is accessible, respectful, and made for real needs.

            <h2>Why We Created Pehchaan</h2>
            <p>
              Pehchaan was created because disabled individuals struggle to find clothes made for their comfort, style, and needs.
              No mainstream brand offers proper adaptive options, so we built a brand where they can finally find clothing that understands them.

            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>
              We design adaptive clothing that prioritizes comfort, dignity and independence. Our garments feature easy openings,
              soft seams, tactile guides and accessible closures to support smooth daily dressing.
              Each piece is crafted with breathable, durable fabrics selected for sensitivity and long-term wear.
              We also offer customization based on individual needs, ensuring every garment feels personal and functional.
              Our brand stands out for its human-centered design approach, combining craftsmanship, accessibility and style in every piece.
